CIRCOS IMAGE DATABASE

I maintain a list of Circos citations, reported by Google Scholar, at

http://www.circos.ca/in_literature/scientific/

and images from the literature at

http://www.circos.ca/images/scientific_literature/

If you would like to have your publication included quickly in this
list, let me know (martink@bcgsc.ca). Sometimes Google Scholar misses
publications, too.
