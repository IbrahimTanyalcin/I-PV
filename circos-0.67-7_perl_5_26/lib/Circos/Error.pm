=head1 NAME

Circos::Error - error handling for Circos

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is not meant to be used directly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Circos is an application for the generation of publication-quality,
circularly composited renditions of genomic data and related
annotations.

Circos is particularly suited for visualizing alignments, conservation
and intra and inter-chromosomal relationships. However, Circos can be
used to plot any kind of 2D data in a circular layout - its use is not
limited to genomics. Circos' use of lines to relate position pairs
(ribbons add a thickness parameter to each end) is effective to
display relationships between objects or positions on one or more
scales.

All documentation is in the form of tutorials at L<http://www.circos.ca>.
